      <strong>Project Description:</strong> The Residential Solar Calculator project plans to combat sustainable energy and electric grid failures by providing information to DFW residents on energy storage and solar panels. The calculator will provide estimates on solar panel pricing and batteries by taking inputs from the user and working alongside Pvwatts to calculate information to aid the user in their pricing and adequate needs. The end goal of the project is to have a functioning web application where users can receive information such as battery size needed for outages, total cost on solar panels, and time it would take for solar panels to pay themselves off.
